# Project Change Request

## Proposed Change
Embed a custom **Windy weather map** into the personal introduction website.  
The map would display live weather data and conditions relevant to the user’s location (or a selected region).

## Reasons for the Change
- Stakeholders may want to enhance the site’s interactivity and make it more engaging.  
- The weather map adds a practical, real-world feature that connects the project to everyday needs.  
- It demonstrates applied HTML/CSS/embedding skills, aligning with the course goal of practicing web development.

## How This Change Will Add Value
- Increases **user engagement** by offering live, dynamic content rather than only static text and images.  
- Provides a **practical tool** (weather tracking) that can be useful to visitors, adding credibility and relevance.  
- Highlights technical capability to embed external services, which strengthens both project quality and the student’s portfolio.

## How This Change Will Affect the Constraints
- **Scope**: Expands slightly by adding an interactive feature outside the original static requirement.  
- **Time**: Requires some extra effort to research, configure, and test the embed code.  
- **Cost**: Minimal to none, since Windy provides free embeddable maps.  
- **Quality**: Potential improvement, as the feature adds depth, but also introduces risk of slower page load if not optimized.  
- **Risk**: Low to moderate; embedding may cause formatting or performance issues if not handled carefully.
