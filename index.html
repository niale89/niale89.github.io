    <p>
        Welcome to my personal introduction page! I have created this site as part of a project 
        to gain skills in project management and basic web development. 
        I currently work as an EHS Manager. I decided to obtain a degree so that I can expand career and move to a different position.
        Project Management has always caught my attention and that is one of the goals I have in mind. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Through this course, I'm already learning and understanding so much about project management. 
        I hope that it gives me the confidence in organizing projects, and gain hands-on skills that will help 
        me in my future career.
    </p>
